# About Ashes & Ink

We take public domain texts from the internet and publish them as
paperback or hardback books that are printed on demand when you
place an order meaning we **never** run out of stock.

## You Can Request a Book!

If a book that you would love to have is not available in our store,
you can request it to be made by us for you as long as the content
you want in the book is under the public domain in the US, UK, and
the EU.

If you want a book to be made for you alone and do not want it to be
published on our site, the content can be anything that you have the
rights to.

To request a book, you can contact us from the contact form, or
through any of our socials.
