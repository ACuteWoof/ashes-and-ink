This copy includes the original illustrations from F.H Townsend, and footnotes to translate the French and German phrases — which are not translated in the original copies as the people of Charlotte Brontë’s time and place were expected to be fluent in these languages.`,

The novel follows the story of a painting and the man represented in the painting, Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray, the most beautiful man in London, tempted by Lord Henry's speeches on youth and beauty, as if it were not directly intended, curses himself by a wish to a life where it is no longer he who bears his sin and age but the painting. The novel then continues on how, when he later realises that his wish for youth has been granted, he treats his life and the people who are unfortunate enough to know him.`,

It has been highly influential, along with The Metaphysics and the likes, in the works of many philosophers who came centuries after Aristotle, most famously in St. Thomas Aquinas, such that the influence still remains in the Catholic Church today, although they fell out of favor with those outside the Church during the enlightenment.`,
