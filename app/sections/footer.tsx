          <p>
            We take public domain texts from the internet and publish them as
            paperback or hardback books that are printed on demand when you
            place an order meaning we <b>never</b> run out of stock.

          <p>
            The books in the store for Latin and Greek books linked at the
            header as &quot;Libri Latini&quot; does not fall under any of the
            &quot;about us&quot; or copyright information found here. It is only
            linked as it is run by the same person. There are however plans for
            the future to merge the content of that store with {"Ashes & Ink"}.

          <p>
            If a book that you would love to have is not available in our store,
            you can request it to be made by us for you as long as the content
            you want in the book is under the public domain in the US, UK, and
            the EU.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want a book to be made for you alone and do not want it to be
            published on our site, the content can be anything that you have the
            rights to.
          </p>
